# Examples

This section contains practical examples demonstrating how to use PyProforma for financial modeling and reporting.

## Available Examples

### [Revenues and Expenses Financial Model](revenues_and_expenses_example.md)

A comprehensive example that demonstrates:

- **Multiple Revenue Streams**: Product sales, service revenue, licensing fees, and subscription revenue
- **Complex Expense Modeling**: Cost of goods sold, service delivery, marketing, R&D, and administrative expenses  
- **Formula Relationships**: Expenses calculated as percentages of revenues with automatic updates
- **Professional Tables**: Formatted financial statements with totals and subtotals
- **Interactive Charts**: Visual representations of revenue trends and financial metrics
- **Export Capabilities**: Excel output with formatting and YAML model persistence

**Key Learning Points:**
- Creating line items with formulas that reference other items
- Organizing financial data into logical categories
- Generating professional financial reports
- Visualizing financial data with interactive charts
- Building scalable financial models that grow with your business

This example covers a complete 3-year financial projection (2024-2026) and serves as a template for building your own financial models.

## Getting Started

Each example is available as both a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) and markdown (`.md`) format:
